Hello! I have a question about this invariant mentioned in the docs `The ERC20TokenEmitter and AuctionHouse should always pay creators (ETH or ERC20) in accordance with the creatorRateBps and entropyRateBps calculation.`.

Does this mean that when an auction is being settled the `creatorRateBps` and `entropyRateBps` values should be the same between paying creators in eth/weth and any additional `NontransferableERC20Vote` tokens?


[12/14/2023 18:14] albertwh1te
Same question here.


[12/14/2023 18:48] rocketman_21
Common questions

**Creators address on TokenEmitter**
the `creatorsAddress` stored in the `ERC20TokenEmitter` is for all intents and purposes different than the creator(s) of art pieces that get paid as part of the auction. 

the `creatorsAddress` could be the founding team, or a different splits contract that pays a bunch of builders etc.

**Art piece lifecycle**
art pieces stay forever, once an art piece meets the quorum assuming it has the most # of votes it can be dropped

**Quorum on CultureIndex**
the quorum on `CultureIndex` is meant to be a protection against flash attacks / voter apathy

so eg: someone couldn't submit a piece that was the most voted, but didn't actually have broad community support right before the next auction

**Always pay creators invariant (The ERC20TokenEmitter and AuctionHouse should always pay creators)**
That invariant put another way just means that the creator(s) of the art piece and the creatorsAddress in the TokenEmitter should always be paid with:

every auction settlement the creator(s) receive ETH + ERC20 in accordance with creatorRateBps and entropyRateBps
every buyToken call on the TokenEmitter - creatorsAddress receives ETH + ERC20 in accordance with creatorRateBps and entropyRateBps

basically that there's no way to settle an auction and not pay creators according to the rateBps values, or buyToken and do the same

{Reactions}
üëçüèæ thankyou 

[12/14/2023 18:51] tumelo_crypto
Make sure foundry is installed first that sorted out my problem


[12/14/2023 18:52] rocketman_21
Can you expand what you mean here? That invariant put another way just means that the creator(s) of the art piece and the `creatorsAddress` in the TokenEmitter should always be paid with:

1. every auction settlement the creator(s) receive ETH + ERC20 in accordance with `creatorRateBps` and `entropyRateBps`
2. every buyToken call on the TokenEmitter - `creatorsAddress` receives ETH + ERC20 in accordance with `creatorRateBps` and `entropyRateBps`

basically that there's no way to settle an auction and not pay creators *according to the rateBps* values, or `buyToken` and do the same


[12/14/2023 19:00] plamablocks
Thanks for the response! 

My questions specifically is does this invariant mean that the `creatorRateBps` and `entropyRateBps` values used when calculating the amount of ETH to send to creator(s)/buyer(s) should be the same values used by the TokenEmitter to send ERC-20 to creator(s)/buyer(s)?


[12/14/2023 19:43] rocketman_21
no - the rates can be different between the `tokenemitter` and the `auctionhouse`

Hi, you just have to run 'FOUNDRY_PROFILE=dev' before compiling 

==> FOUNDRY_PROFILE=dev forge test --match-test "yourTest"


[12/15/2023 10:49] th3l1ghtd3m0n
`FOUNDRY_PROFILE` is a variable that you set to `dev` if you want compile `revolution` packages more quickly.
If you use bash in your terminal, just run `export FOUNDRY_PROFILE=dev` and you can run forge tests normally.

I aimed to stay silent and concentrate on the audit throughout this contest, but I can't help but say how brilliantly structured your test suite is. It has been one of the best learning moments for me in my (short) time as a security researcher. My only hope is for an extension of the contest duration to allow one to fully explore the codebase.

is `VRGDAC.sol` made from scratch? (Besides using `SignedWadMath.sol`?)


[12/18/2023 14:28] rocketman_21
made it based on work from t11s here: https://github.com/transmissions11/VRGDAs/tree/master/src

and https://twitter.com/transmissions11/status/1726676403066925164


[12/18/2023 14:31] babs2833
ahh im totally blind, i even clicked that too before hah ty


[12/18/2023 14:34] babs2833
In `ERC20TokenEmitter.t.sol` we have `int256 priceDecayPercent = 1e18 / 10;`. Is this 10%?

 And for example with `decayConstant = wadLn(1e18 - _priceDecayPercent);` from `VRGDAC.sol` 

This is equated to `WadLn(0.9e18)` = Ln(0.9)*1e18 = -0.10536e18, or about -10.5%?


[12/18/2023 14:38] babs2833
*For others I see this in `AuctionHouse.t.sol` which explains more

```
        // //20% - how much the price decays per unit of time with no sales 
        // int256 priceDecayPercent = 1e18 / 10; = 0.1e18
        // // 1e11 or 0.0000001 is 2 cents per token even at $200k eth price
        // int256 tokenTargetPrice = 1e11;
```

I'll have to dig a bit more


[12/18/2023 16:01] rocketman_21
yes that is 10% - I'd check out the OG VRGDA implementation as well


[12/18/2023 16:02] rocketman_21
decay constant is just ln(1-decayPercent) afaik, scaled by 1e18

on the desmos it shows up a bunch

which address should I prank to pause the Auction contract? 
Test call unpause which is onlyOwner but whenever I try to pause the contract it says i'm unautorized


[12/18/2023 17:30] aamirusmani1552
try `contract.owner()`


[12/18/2023 18:32] osmanozdemir1
You can also check the RevolutionBuilder contract. That one is out of scope but you can see who is initialized as the owner

[12/19/2023 02:54] 0x11singh99
@rocketman ‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñÄ  ` ERC20VotesUpgradeable public erc20VotingToken`  and
` ERC721CheckpointableUpgradeable public erc721VotingToken;`  in `CultureIndex` are of the same token  contracts ie. of  `NonTransefrrableERC20Votes` and `VerbsToken` Or they are just deffernet ?


[12/19/2023 04:39] babs2833
If anyone had trouble running traditional foundry test with files never compiling, you can do:

`pnpm run test --match-path ./test/auction/TestFileHereForExample.t.sol` Once inside `packages/revolution` for example.

Trying traditional `forge test ...` just made everything compile forever for some reason, but this other way worked.


[12/19/2023 07:35] duc6888
it's not working on the turbo run test, how can I fix that?

[12/19/2023 13:05] thetechnofeak
creator_share = (msg.value * creatorRateBps) / 10_000, on what thigns does the creatorRateBps depends and how it is calculated?


[12/19/2023 13:09] nmirchev8
Is it possible for a user to withdraw a vote?


[12/19/2023 13:39] rocketman_21
FYI 

the `creatorsAddress` will likely be a contract built by the DAO, updated by the DAO, that quadratically funds the top builders in the community


[12/19/2023 13:41] rocketman_21
they're effectively the same, `VerbsToken` inherits `ERC721CheckpointableUpgradeable` and `NonTransefrrableERC20Votes` inherits `ERC20VotesUpgradeable`

Why do we have name and description on `culture index`? Is it supposed to support multiple indexes in a same time, or?


[12/19/2023 14:29] rocketman_21
the DAO can set it to any BPS value <= 10_000, what do you mean what does it depend on?


[12/19/2023 14:29] rocketman_21
the idea is the community might create a new index with new rules/name down the line

{Reactions}
‚úÖ 

[12/19/2023 14:46] rocketman_21
FYI - we're aiming to sell ~1000 ERC20 tokens per day, meaning the `erc721VotingTokenWeight` in the cultureIndex will likely be set to 1000

Does it mean, that when at the Piece creation block my voting power was X, and now, my voting power is Y - voting now will vote with X power?


[12/19/2023 15:52] tychaios.
Yes, it's snapshotted


[12/19/2023 15:53] lsaudit
So I can only vote with the power I had when Piece was created? It does not matter what power I have now?

[12/20/2023 20:36] rocketman_21
the address(dao) should work as the owner of all the functions to start, what test suite are you running though? check out the test suite setup to see if an alternative owner was set, and also check `RevolutionBuilder.t.sol`

Pretty normal considering the high participation rate troughout the last months.
From experience, there are also many duplicates.

Concerning access to the findings repo, please reach out to the C4 team.
Usually it's handed over to the sponsor after pre-sorting, but imho it should be no problem for you to view it before.

Hello everyone. Now that the contest is over can someone please guide me on how I could have setup formal verification on this code base. I‚Äôm fairly new to auditing and I‚Äôm trying to level up by learning FV and I feel the maths in the codebase is straight forward enough for me to get started with. I tried setting it up SMT checker but I kept getting errors (mostly from the imported libraries) and it was starting to take up a lot of time.

You don‚Äôt have to give away any findings or anything like that, just a list of instructions or packages I could use to setup FV for the reward distribution and Dutch auction part of codebase. 

I‚Äôd really appreciate any help, Thanksüôèüèº

Once wardens have established themselves in the community and met certain criteria they get backstage access to the repo so they can discuss their issues during Post-Judging QA üôÇ

[01/12/2024 15:25] 0xg03.14
i think one of my finding got invalidated. is there anything i can do.

[01/12/2024 15:39] 0x11singh99
Unfortunately No. For now but you can see c4 docs disagree with judges , after report will be made public


[01/12/2024 15:40] 0xg03.14
anyone with backstage help me with this


[01/12/2024 15:40] 0xg03.14
i just wanted to know why my issue got invalidated


[01/12/2024 15:41] 0x11singh99
No it is not allowed in c4 currently


[01/12/2024 15:43] 0x11singh99
For this you need to be certified and got your +backstage role. Then you can participate in post judging QA. Apart from this I don't think there is any way possible.

[01/17/2024 21:22] _paperparachute
I've just noticed you aren't actually in the awarding list? Are you expecting a payment for something? I'll take this to a private thread, one moment.

This is my first reward. When is should be distributed, in my Metamask balance?


[01/19/2024 09:57] benrai
The rewards are send in USDC on the Polygon network


[01/19/2024 10:00] donkicha
Yes, but my account balance is 0


[01/19/2024 10:27] osmanozdemir1
Did you import usdc token in your metamask


[01/19/2024 10:29] osmanozdemir1
Mm wallet won‚Äôt show your tokens if you didn‚Äôt import the token, but you can check your balance via polygonscan in that case


[01/19/2024 10:30] donkicha
Yes, I think it is not imported


[01/19/2024 10:30] donkicha
I am trying to import it, but it says me this:

This token does not appear to be supported. Please check your MetaMask network.


[01/19/2024 10:44] jvorex
still experiencing the issue?


[01/19/2024 10:44] donkicha
I didn't managed to import it...


[01/19/2024 10:45] jvorex
so the issue persists then


[01/19/2024 10:46] jvorex
go to Metamask > Make sure you're on the Polygon Network > Import tokens > Paste the USDC.e contract address > Click Next


[01/19/2024 10:46] jvorex
This is the USDC.e address: 0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174
