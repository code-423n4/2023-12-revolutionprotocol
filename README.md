# Overview
# the Revolution protocol ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®

## intro
Revolution is a set of contracts that improve on [Nouns DAO](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo). Nouns is a generative avatar collective that auctions off one ERC721, every day, forever. 100% of the proceeds of each auction (the winning bid) go into a shared treasury, and owning an NFT gets you 1 vote over the treasury. 

Compared to Nouns, Revolution seeks to make governance token ownership more accessible to creators and builders, and balance the scales between culture and capital while committing to a constant governance inflation schedule. 

The ultimate goal of Revolution is fair ownership distribution over a community movement where anyone can earn decision making power over the energy of the movement.

## overview
In Revolution, instead of [auctioning](https://nouns.wtf/) off a generative PFP, anyone can upload art pieces to the [CultureIndex](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-collective/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/CultureIndex.sol) contract, and the community votes on their favorite art pieces. The top piece is auctioned off every day via the [AuctionHouse](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/VerbsAuctionHouse.sol). 

A portion of the auction proceeds is split with the creator(s) of the art piece, and the rest is sent to the DAO treasury. The winner of the auction receives an ERC721 of the art piece, and the creator receives an amount of ERC20 governance tokens and ether. Both the ERC721 and the ERC20 governance token have voting power to vote on art pieces in the **CultureIndex**. 

## relevant contracts

### CultureIndex
[**CultureIndex.sol**](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/CultureIndex.sol) is a directory of uploaded art pieces that anyone can add media to. Owners of a specific ERC721 or ERC20 can vote on any given art piece. The art piece votes data is stored in [**MaxHeap.sol**](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/MaxHeap.sol), a heap datastructure that enables O(1) lookups of the highest voted art piece. 

The contract has a function called **dropTopVotedPiece**, only callable by the owner, which pops (removes) the top voted item from the **MaxHeap** and returns it. 

### VerbsToken
[**VerbsToken.sol**](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/VerbsToken.sol) is a fork of the [NounsToken](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/master/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsToken.sol) contract. **VerbsToken** owns the **CultureIndex**. When calling **mint()** on the **VerbsToken**, the contract calls **dropTopVotedPiece** on **CultureIndex**, and creates the ERC721 metadata based on the returned data from the CultureIndex. 

### AuctionHouse
[**VerbsAuctionHouse.sol**](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/VerbsAuctionHouse.sol) is a fork of the [NounsAuctionHouse](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/master/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouse.sol) contract, that mints **VerbsToken**s. Additionally, the **AuctionHouse** splits proceeds of the auction (the amount paid by the winning bidder) with the creator(s) of the art piece that is minted.

#### Creator payment
The **creatorRateBps** defines the proportion (in basis points) of the auction proceeds that is reserved for the creator(s) of the art piece, called the _creator's share_. The **entropyRateBps** defines the proportion of the _creator's share_ that is sent to the creator directly in ether. The remaining amount of the _creator's share_ is sent to the [TokenEmitter](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/TokenEmitter.sol) contract's **buyToken** function to buy the creator ERC20 governance tokens, according to a linear token emission schedule.

### TokenEmitter
**[TokenEmitter.sol](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/TokenEmitter.sol)** is a linear VRGDA that mints an ERC20 token when the payable **buyToken** function is called, and enables anyone to purchase the ERC20 governance token at any time.

You can read more about VRGDA's [here](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda), and view the implementation for NFTs [here](https://github.com/transmissions11/VRGDAs). Basically, a VRGDA contract dynamically adjusts the price of a token to adhere to a specific issuance schedule. 

<img width="903" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 8 31 54 PM" src="https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/assets/20303031/86b23fbf-3095-41bd-b0f5-f885c46d1772">

You can read more about the implementation on [Paradigm's site](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda). 

The Token Emitter utilizes a continuous VRGDA (VRGDAC) to facilitate ERC20 token purchases. Given an amount of ether to pay, it will return the number of tokens to sell (YtoX), and given an amount of tokens to buy, will return the cost (XtoY) where x is the ERC20 token and Y is ether as defined in [VRGDAC.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/libs/VRGDAC.sol). The original VRGDAC implementation is [here](https://gist.github.com/transmissions11/485a6e2deb89236202bd2f59796262fd). 

In order to get the amount of tokens to emit given a payment of ether (YtoX in [VRGDAC.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/libs/VRGDAC.sol)), we first take the integral of the linear VRGDA pricing function p(x). Then - we can get the cost of a specific number of tokens (XtoY in [VRGDAC.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/libs/VRGDAC.sol)) by doing p_integral(x_start+x_bought) - p_integral(x_start) where x_start is the current supply of the ERC20 and x_bought is the amount of tokens you wish to purchase. We can then solve for x_bought using a handy python [solver](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/script/solve.py) to find YtoX, allowing us to pass in an amount of ether and receive an amount of tokens to sell.

<img width="1727" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 8 34 22 PM" src="https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/assets/20303031/d38b7e81-9c7f-4210-a146-65dcfab933b1">
The green line is the pricing function p(x) for a linear VRGDA. The red line is the integral of p(x), and the purple line signifies the amount of ERC20 tokens you'd receive given a payment in ether. The relevant functions and integrals for the VRGDAC are available [here.](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/im67z1tate) 


#### Creator payment
The contract has a **creatorRateBps** and **entropyRateBps** that function the same as the **AuctionHouse** contract's. Whenever a **buyToken** purchase of governance tokens is made, a **creatorRateBps** portion of the proceeds is reserved for the **creatorsAddress** set in the contract, with direct payment calculated according to the **entropyRateBps**.

#### Protocol rewards
A fixed percentage of the value sent to the **buyToken** function is paid to the **TokenEmitterRewards** contract. The rewards setup is modeled after Zora's _fixed_ [protocol rewards](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/tree/main/packages/protocol-rewards). The key difference is that instead of a _fixed_ amount of ETH being split between the creator, builder, referrer, deployer, and architect, the **TokenEmitterRewards** system splits a percentage of the value to relevant parties.
