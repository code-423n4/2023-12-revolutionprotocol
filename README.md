## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Add code to this repo

- [ ] Create a PR to this repo with the below changes:
- [ ] Provide a self-contained repository with working commands that will build (at least) all in-scope contracts, and commands that will run tests producing gas reports for the relevant contracts.
- [ ] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 48 business hours prior to audit start time.**
- [ ] Be prepared for a üö®code freezeüö® for the duration of the audit ‚Äî important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the audit. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Edit this `README.md` file

- [ ] Modify the contents of this `README.md` file. Describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation#readme))
- [ ] Review the Gas award pool amount. This can be adjusted up or down, based on your preference - just flag it for Code4rena staff so we can update the pool totals across all comms channels.
- [ ] Optional / nice to have: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] [This checklist in Notion](https://code4rena.notion.site/Key-info-for-Code4rena-sponsors-f60764c4c4574bbf8e7a6dbd72cc49b4#0cafa01e6201462e9f78677a39e09746) provides some best practices for Code4rena audits.

# the Revolution protocol ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®

Revolution is a set of contracts that improve on [Nouns DAO](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo). Nouns is a generative avatar collective that auctions off one ERC721, every day, forever. 100% of the proceeds of each auction (the winning bid) go into a shared treasury, and owning an NFT gets you 1 vote over the treasury.

<img width="377" alt="noun" src="https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/readme-img/noun.png">

Compared to Nouns, Revolution seeks to make governance token ownership more accessible to creators and builders, and balance the scales between culture and capital while committing to a constant governance inflation schedule. 

The ultimate goal of Revolution is fair ownership distribution over a community movement where anyone can earn decision making power over the energy of the movement. If this excites you, [build with us](mailto:rocketman@collective.xyz).

# revolution overview
Instead of [auctioning](https://nouns.wtf/) off a generative PFP like Nouns, anyone can upload art pieces to the [CultureIndex](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-collective/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/CultureIndex.sol) contract, and the community votes on their favorite art pieces. 

The top piece is auctioned off every day as an ERC721 [VerbsToken](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/VerbsToken.sol) via the [AuctionHouse](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/VerbsAuctionHouse.sol). 

The auction proceeds are split with the creator(s) of the art piece, and the rest is sent to the owner of the auction contract. The winner of the auction receives an ERC721 of the art piece. The creator receives an amount of ERC20 governance tokens and a share of the winning bid. 

The ERC20 tokens the creator receives is calculated by the [TokenEmitter](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/TokenEmitter.sol). Both the ERC721 and the ERC20 governance token have voting power to vote on art pieces in the **CultureIndex**. 

# relevant contracts

## CultureIndex
[**CultureIndex.sol**](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/CultureIndex.sol) is a directory of uploaded art pieces that anyone can add media to. Owners of a specific ERC721 or ERC20 can vote on any given art piece.

<img width="817" alt="culture index" src="https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/readme-img/culture-index.png">

 The art piece votes data is stored in [**MaxHeap.sol**](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/MaxHeap.sol), a heap datastructure that enables efficient lookups of the highest voted art piece. 

The contract has a function called **dropTopVotedPiece**, only callable by the owner, which pops (removes) the top voted item from the **MaxHeap** and returns it. 

## VerbsToken
[**VerbsToken.sol**](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/VerbsToken.sol) is a fork of the [NounsToken](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/master/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsToken.sol) contract. **VerbsToken** owns the **CultureIndex**. When calling **mint()** on the **VerbsToken**, the contract calls **dropTopVotedPiece** on **CultureIndex**, and creates an ERC721 with metadata based on the dropped art piece data from the **CultureIndex**. 

## AuctionHouse
[**VerbsAuctionHouse.sol**](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/VerbsAuctionHouse.sol) is a fork of the [NounsAuctionHouse](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/master/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouse.sol) contract, that mints **VerbsToken**s. Additionally, the **AuctionHouse** splits auction proceeds (the winning bid) with the creator(s) of the art piece that is minted.

<img width="882" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 11 25 27 AM" src="https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/readme-img/vrb-auction.png">

### Creator payment
The **creatorRateBps** defines the proportion (in basis points) of the auction proceeds that is reserved for the creator(s) of the art piece, called the _creator's share_. 

```
creator_share = (msg.value * creatorRateBps) / 10_000
```

The **entropyRateBps** defines the proportion of the _creator's share_ that is sent to the creator directly in ether. 

```
direct creator payment = (creator_share * entropyRateBps) / 10_000
```

The remaining amount of the _creator's share_ is sent to the [TokenEmitter](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/TokenEmitter.sol) contract's **buyToken** function to buy the creator ERC20 governance tokens, according to a linear token emission schedule.

## TokenEmitter
**[TokenEmitter.sol](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/TokenEmitter.sol)** is a linear [VRGDA](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda) that mints an ERC20 token when the payable **buyToken** function is called, and enables anyone to purchase the ERC20 governance token at any time. A portion of value spent on buying the ERC20 tokens is paid to creators and to a protocol rewards contract.

### Creator payment
The TokenEmitter has a **creatorRateBps** and **entropyRateBps** that function the same as the **AuctionHouse** contract's. Whenever a **buyToken** purchase of governance tokens is made, a **creatorRateBps** portion of the proceeds is reserved for the **creatorsAddress** set in the contract, with direct payment calculated according to the **entropyRateBps**.


### Protocol rewards
A fixed percentage of the value sent to the **buyToken** function is paid to the **TokenEmitterRewards** contract. The rewards setup is modeled after Zora's _fixed_ [protocol rewards](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/tree/main/packages/protocol-rewards). The key difference is that instead of a _fixed_ amount of ETH being split between the builder, referrer, deployer, and architect, the **TokenEmitterRewards** system splits a percentage of the value to relevant parties. 


## VRGDA
The TokenEmitter utilizes a VRGDA to emit ERC20 tokens at a predictable rate. You can read more about VRGDA's [here](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda), and view the implementation for selling NFTs [here](https://github.com/transmissions11/VRGDAs). Basically, a VRGDA contract dynamically adjusts the price of a token to adhere to a specific issuance schedule. If the emission is ahead of schedule, the price increases exponentially. If it is behind schedule, the price of each token decreases by some constant decay rate.

## Out of scope

All the contracts not mentioned in scope including all test files. Any issues that were raised in the previous 2 Nouns audits. Findings [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-nounsdao-findings) and [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao-findings).

Any issues or improvements on how we integrate with the out of scope contracts is in scope.

## Main invariants
*Describe the project's main invariants (properties that should NEVER EVER be broken).*

The TokenEmitter should always pay creators.

The AuctionHouse should always pay creators.

Anything uploaded to the CultureIndex should always be mintable by the VerbsToken contract and not disrupt the token contract in any way.

The VerbsToken should only mint art pieces from the CultureIndex.

The AuctionHouse should only auction off tokens from the VerbsToken.

The AuctionHouse should always pay creator(s) of the CultureIndex art piece being auctioned.

The TokenEmitter should always pay the `creatorsAddress`.

The VRGDAC should always exponentially increase the price of tokens if the supply is ahead of schedule.


# Additional Context

### VRGDAC
The Token Emitter utilizes a continuous VRGDA ([VRGDAC.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/libs/VRGDAC.sol)) to facilitate ERC20 token purchases. Given an amount of ether to pay, it will return the number of tokens to sell (`YtoX`), and given an amount of tokens to buy, will return the cost (`XtoY`) where X is the ERC20 token and Y is ether. The original VRGDAC implementation is [here](https://gist.github.com/transmissions11/485a6e2deb89236202bd2f59796262fd). 

In order to get the amount of tokens to emit given a payment of ether (`YtoX` in [VRGDAC.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/libs/VRGDAC.sol)), we first take the integral of the linear VRGDA pricing function [p(x)](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda).

<img width="487" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 9 21 59 PM" src="https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/readme-img/vrgda-c-integral.png">

Then - we can get the cost of a specific number of tokens (`XtoY` in [VRGDAC.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/libs/VRGDAC.sol)) by doing `p_integral(x_start+x_bought) - p_integral(x_start)` where `x_start` is the current supply of the ERC20 and `x_bought` is the amount of tokens you wish to purchase. 

We can then solve for `x_bought` using a handy python [solver](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/script/solve.py) to find `YtoX`, allowing us to pass in an amount of ether and receive an amount of tokens to sell.

The green line is the pricing function p(x) for a linear VRGDA. The red line is the integral of p(x), and the purple line signifies the amount of ERC20 tokens you'd receive given a payment in ether (YtoX). The relevant functions and integrals for the VRGDAC are available here: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/im67z1tate.

## Attack ideas (Where to look for bugs)

Compared to Nouns DAO, complexity arises from the auction of community created/voted art, and direct payments to creators. So - focusing on ways in which the `CultureIndex` -> `VerbsToken` -> `VerbsAuctionHouse` flow can be attacked, or DOS'd to prevent community intent from manifesting is a good start. Additionally, exploring creator governance token accumulation attack vectors is a solid start.

### Where to start

Begin by examining the access control and permissions for contracts that make up the art piece to AuctionHouse flow, such as the CultureIndex. It‚Äôs essential to ensure that access is tightly constrained and locked down to prevent unauthorized or malicious activities. Next, ensure the logic and flow of the system does not have any gaps or unexpected edge cases. This step is foundational to the system‚Äôs security and continued operation. Also, review the TokenEmitter contract's ownership and permissions to prevent governance takeover.

### [CultureIndex](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-collective/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/CultureIndex.sol) attacks

Checking that the CultureIndex or the MaxHeap can not be DOS'd where voting or creating art becomes prohibitively expensive, within a reasonable attack cost (~50 ETH). Keep in mind the CultureIndex can be reset by the VerbsToken to potentially relieve some pressure. 

Ensuring nothing uploaded to CultureIndex could break or otherwise disrupt the minting functionality of the VerbsToken.

### [TokenEmitter](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-collective/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/TokenEmitter.sol) attacks

Another large distinction from Nouns is that there are 2 classes of governance shares, the ERC721 auction item (VerbsToken) and the nontransferable ERC20. These two tokens are used to vote on the CultureIndex and choose the next auction item, and in the future will be used to govern a DAO with a treasury. It is essential to explore potential ways in which the ERC20 emission from the TokenEmitter can be exploited to gain an outsized governance share. 

### Creator rate attacks

The system is further complicated by the creator payments on both the AuctionHouse and the TokenEmitter. The DAO is able to unilaterally set both the `creatorRateBps` and `entropyRateBps` on both the Auction and TokenEmitter. The CultureIndex voting setup and quorum determins the creator(s) paid as part of the Auction. The DAO can set the `creatorsAddress` on the TokenEmitter. Given creators will be paid directly, ensure malicious creator contracts cannot disrupt the system.

## Tokens used on launch and anticipated to interact with.

### ERC20

USDC, and the [NontransferableERC20Votes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/NontransferableERC20Votes.sol)

### ERC721

[VerbsToken](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/VerbsToken.sol)

## Blockchains

Ethereum

## Trusted roles
- [ ] Please list all trusted roles (e.g. operators, slashers, pausers, etc.), the privileges they hold, and any conditions under which privilege escalation is expected/allowable


## DOS
Minimum duration after which we would consider a DOS finding to be valid?

DOS on CultureIndex: 20m


## EIP conformity
  - [VerbsToken](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/VerbsToken.sol): Should comply with `ERC721`
  - [NontransferableERC20Votes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol/blob/main/packages/revolution-contracts/src/NontransferableERC20Votes.sol): Should comply with `ERC20`

- How many contracts are in scope?: 10
- Total SLoC for these contracts?: 1000  
- How many external imports are there?: 13  
- How many separate interfaces and struct definitions are there for the contracts within scope?: 13  
- Does most of your code generally use composition or inheritance?: Inheritance   
- How many external calls?: 1   
- What is the overall line coverage percentage provided by your tests?: 73
- Is this an upgrade of an existing system?:

True - We're upgrading Nouns DAO so that the auction item is a piece of community created art, voted on by the community. Additionally, we are issuing an ERC20 governance token to the creator and splitting the auction proceeds with the creator of the art.

- Check all that apply (e.g. timelock, NFT, AMM, ERC20, rollups, etc.): NFT, Uses L2, ERC-20 Token
- Is there a need to understand a separate part of the codebase / get context in order to audit this part of the protocol?: False  
- Please describe required context:   
- Does it use an oracle?: No
- Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models your code uses: We use a continuous VRGDA function, built by Paradigm (https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda). It enables a linear emission of ERC20 tokens over time. 
- Is this either a fork of or an alternate implementation of another project?: True  
- Does it use a side-chain?:
- Describe any specific areas you would like addressed:
